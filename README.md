# DreamSpace – AI Interior Design Visualizer

DreamSpace redesigns real room photos using AI-powered image-to-image interior styling.

## Features
- Securely store your Stability API key in your browser using local storage.
- Upload any room photo via drag-and-drop or file picker.
- Choose from curated interior design prompts (Minimalist, Cozy Scandinavian, Japandi, Luxury Modern, Cyberpunk Neon, Warm Boho).
- Compare original and redesigned images with an interactive before/after slider.
- Download the generated redesign with a single click.

## Getting Started
1. Open `index.html` directly in your browser (double-click the file or use `file://` path).
2. Paste your [Stability API Key](https://platform.stability.ai/account/keys).
3. Upload a photo of your room.
4. Select an interior style.
5. Click **Redesign Room**.
6. Drag the slider to compare the before and after.
7. Click **Download** to save the redesigned image.

> **Note:** Image generation happens via Stability AI's hosted API, so an internet connection and available API credits are required.

## Project Structure
```
index.html   # Application markup and layout
